To fix:
- Carrier catapults don't work unless you spawn as a carrier aircraft
- Autospoilers broken: update with Kolos26 3.5+ version
- Fix 2d clouds density mod
- Debug autoland (despite the script using black magic to try and hide its loading path)
- Fix HUD/PFD placement
- Finish refining multiplayer aircraft sounds and re-add
- Add differential aircraft sound to F-15C
- Fix issue where if you decelerate from M>1 to M<1 while camera is in front of aircraft, it does not resume playing engine sound
- Game forgets to load carrier hitbox sometimes (possibly caused by carrier catapults script? also check if there are any other scripts
that interfere with object loading)
- Make Flankers not prone to flat spins
