# Realism-pack
This is a bookmarklet addon. Here's a tutorial on bookmarklets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNDEesTbKc4.</br>

You'll never have to worry about updating your copy of the addon; the bookmarklet will automatically call the latest version of the addon.

**Note:** please wait until the instruments have loaded before clicking on the bookmarklet. If it is clicked before GeoFS is running, it will not run.</br>
**HOW TO USE THE CARRIER CATAPULTS:** Go to the flight deck of the USS John C. Stennis and taxi to the front end of the deck, then use "q" to lock/unlock the launch bar. Once the launch bar is locked, use "~" to launch the catapult. It is recommended to apply full power before launching.

This combines several addons that enhance the realism of GeoFS. In this one bookmarklet is contained:

- Realistic KIAS for exterior instruments
- ILS autoland (if you're on an autopilot ILS approach, the plane will be able to land itself)
- A rudimentary form of **multiplayer aircraft sounds**
- You black out when you pull more than 9 Gs
- AriakimTaiyo's 737 and 777 immersion sound effects
- If you strike the rotor blades of a helicopter on the ground, it crashes
- A bug fix for the F-14 and XB-70
- F-14 swing wing physics
- Carrier catapults
- Lift-based wingflex for most CC airliners
- Falcon 9 control fix
- A massive realism fix for the HAL Tejas
- A similar fix for the F-15
- F-22 fix
- *Tricky Corsair startup* (you'll need to advance the throttle a little bit to get the engine to start)
- Basic fly-by-wire for the F-16's pitch
- Turbofan engines now take longer to spool up to full power between 10% and 70% RPM
- Advanced 2d Clouds Generation V1
- Autospoilers (use Shift+B to arm the spoilers so they automatically deploy on touchdown)
- Ejection seats for fighter jets (press E while airborne)
- A machmeter on the HUD
- Lag reduction
- Other minor improvements

There are a few things that have been removed, they will be added back when I can get them to work. You may also notice incomplete stuff in the code; that's going to be finished at some point as well.

Other parts of this addon may also be buggy or broken, please let me know if you've discovered a problem. I use this addon myself and so a lot of the bugs are ironed out before updates, but there may still be things I missed.
