# Realism-pack
This massive addon adds over 33 new features, realism fixes, and a few bug fixes. The goal of this project is to modify GeoFS to make it as realistic as possible and expand its capabilities.</br>
You can review the full list of additional features and changes below.


**HOW TO INSTALL:**</br>
*If you want to run the bookmarklet version:*
- Watch this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNDEesTbKc4.
- Follow that tutorial, but set the contents of bookmarklet.js as the URL.

*If you want to run the Tampermonkey version:*
- Make sure you have Tampermonkey installed
- Add tampermonkey-code.js as a new userscript

You'll never have to worry about updating your copy of the addon.

**HOW TO USE:**</br>
If you run the bookmarklet version, please wait until the terrain has loaded before clicking on the bookmarklet. Otherwise you might have terrain collision bugs.</br>

*How to use the carrier catapults:*
Go to the flight deck of the USS John C. Stennis and taxi to the front end of the deck, then use "q" to lock/unlock the launch bar. Once the launch bar is locked, use "~" to launch the catapult. It is recommended to apply full power before launching. </br>

You will notice a few new settings in the options panel. They are on by default.</br>

*How to use the addon chat:*</br>
At the bottom of the locations panel is an addon chat room. To use this, simply click the input text box, type your message, press "enter", then click somewhere else.
