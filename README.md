# Realism-pack
This combines several addons that enhance the realism of GeoFS. In this one bookmarklet is contained:

- AP++
- Spoiler arming (doesn't work, will try to fix)
- Carrier catapults (doesn't work, will try to fix)
- You black out when you pull more than 9 Gs
- A bug fix for the F-14 and XB-70
- F-14 swing wing physics
- Falcon 9 control fix
- Propeller torque and propwash (doesn't work, will try to fix)
- Mach buffet
- Lag reduction
- Other minor improvements

If anti-aliasing is off, the flight recorder cache is cleared every 100 milliseconds, making the flight recorder unusable. To re-enable the flight recorder, turn on anti-aliasing. (I haven't confirmed that this works lol)

Make sure you use the latest version of this; I update this addon rather frequently.

Also, AP++ is sorta bugged with GeoFS 3.0, you kinda have to fiddle with it and it doesn't work all the time.

A tutorial on how to install bookmarklets is on my YouTube (channel name is NVB9 2).
