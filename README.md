# Realism-pack
This combines several addons that enhance the realism of GeoFS. In this one bookmarklet is contained:

- AP++
- Spoiler arming
- Carrier catapults
- You black out when you pull more than 9 Gs
- A bug fix for the F-14 and XB-70
- F-14 swing wing physics
- Falcon 9 control fix
- Other minor improvements

Make sure you use the latest version of this; I update this addon rather frequently.

Also, AP++ is sorta bugged with GeoFS 3.0, you kinda have to fiddle with it and it doesn't work all the time.

A tutorial on how to install bookmarklets is on my YouTube (channel name is NVB9 2).
